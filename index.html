                <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
                <h2 id="subheading">The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
                <p>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was
                    it. Well
                    it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer,
                    across
                    the US. This year, 3 million kids
                    played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range
                    the MLS
                    has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
                <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into
                    the
                    Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely
                    not
                    chump change. And those advertisers,
                    like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see
                    those
                    numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across
                    the
                    country. </p>
                <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in
                    soccer
                    across the country for years to come. </p>
